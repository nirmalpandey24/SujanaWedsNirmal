                Our story began with a simple chat on Facebook â€” just two souls connected by fate. What started as friendly 
                conversations soon turned into laughter, 
                late-night talks, and endless video calls that made us 
                forget about time. Every moment with you felt 
                different â€” warm, special, and real.
                <span className="hidden md:inline">
                  Then came the moment that changed everything. After only a few days of talking, I realized how deeply I had fallen for you. I couldn't hold back my feelings, so I gathered all my courage and proposed. You took an hour to think â€” and that hour felt like the longest one of my life. But when you finally said yes, my heart knew it had found its home.
                </span>

                <p className="text-base text-gray-500 leading-relaxed font-['Lexend'] md:hidden">
                 From then on, life became more beautiful. We talked for hours, shared dreams, laughed endlessly, and watched our favorite series and movies together â€” each memory becoming a chapter of our love story.

                <p className="text-base text-gray-500 leading-relaxed font-['Lexend']">
                 And then came a miracle. You got a week off and came to Nepal. Those days were pure magic â€” walking through Asan Bazaar, doing late-night shopping, sharing food, and losing myself in your eyes. Your eyes felt like an ocean â€” calm, deep, and full of love. Every moment we spent together became a memory I'll treasure forever.
